            <p>Adeola Model School, which is privately-owned and approved to run as a private Nursery & Primary
                School
                in
                1967
                was established by the Late Chief (Mrs.) Felicia Adeola Adesiyun; a mother and professional teacher
                with
                years
                of exceptional experience in Nigeria and the United Kingdom.</p><br>

            <p>Prior to the approval, the Nursery class was opened in April, 1960, with a class of only four pupils
                and
                the
                first set of six pupils passed out in flying colors to various secondary schools on the 7th of
                December
                1967.
                Ever since, the numbers of our students have increased considerably with over twenty-two classrooms
                and
                adequate
                members of staff.</p><br>

            <p>On 24th June 1967, the then Military Governor of Kwara State, Lt Colonel D.L. Bamigboye visited the
                school
                and
                was very impressed with the rapid growth and quality of standard education provided by the school.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>Ever since then, the school has maintained that of standard and improves the quality of education
                with well-trained teachers, modern classroom technologies and conducive environment for students to
                learn
                faster.
                The
                school now runs from Pre-nursery class to Primary 6 where pupils sit for the First School Leaving
                Examination
                for entry into Secondary Schools of their choice.</p>
